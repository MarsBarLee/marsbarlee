Dearest Earthling,

Here are 4 fun facts about Mars!

- She works at Quansight, poking at front-end code
- She is currently contributing to open-source projects, specifically to NumPy's website, documentation and accessibility
- She has a webcomic called '[CodeSprite Explains](https://twitter.com/codespritee)' which illustrates code concepts in fun ways! It'll update it again eventually...
- She started their digital journey by making art of their Neopets on MS-Paint and never quite stopped
