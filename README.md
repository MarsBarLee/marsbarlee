Dearest Earthling,

Here are 4 fun facts about Mars!

- They work at Quansight, poking at front-end code
- They are currently contributing to open-source projects, specifically to NumPy's website, documentation and accessibility
- They have a webcomic called '[CodeSprite Explains](https://twitter.com/codespritee)' which illustrates code concepts in fun ways! They'll update it again eventually...
- They started their digital journey by making art of their Neopets on MS-Paint and never quite stopped
